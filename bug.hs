This Haskell code attempts to use a pattern match on a Maybe value without handling the Nothing case, leading to a runtime error if the Maybe value is Nothing. 
```haskell
myFunction :: Maybe Int -> Int
myFunction (Just x) = x * 2
```
This will throw a `Non-exhaustive patterns` error at compile time if you use the Haskell compiler with warnings enabled.  If the compiler doesn't catch it (or warnings are disabled), it will crash at runtime when `myFunction` receives `Nothing` as input.
