The corrected code adds a `Nothing` case to handle the scenario where the Maybe value is empty.
```haskell
myFunction :: Maybe Int -> Int
myFunction (Just x) = x * 2
myFunction Nothing = 0 -- Handle the Nothing case
```
This ensures that the function behaves correctly for all possible inputs, preventing runtime errors.  Alternatively, you could throw an error or use a different default value based on the application's needs.
